# daily-work-scheduler

## description
this is a daily scheduler that tells you the past, present, and future by using different colors. The motivation for this project was to get a better understanding by practicing how to code using both jQuerry and Bootstrap. It solves as a time tracker and quick way to make some notes during my daily coding. I learned more about for loops and nested for loops as well as how to use Bootstrap and jQuerry.

## summary 
this was a new task for me to try. during this process I have learned how to remake console log everything, which in turn takes longer but allows for everything to be checked at each step.
